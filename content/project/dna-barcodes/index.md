Fern gametophytes, as the sexual phase of the fern lifecycle, are critically important to fern biology. However, due to their small size and simple morphology, the field ecology of fern gametophytes has for the most part been literally overlooked. I am developing methods that use short diagnostic DNA sequences, or “barcodes,” to identify fern gametophytes so that they can be more easily studied in the field.
