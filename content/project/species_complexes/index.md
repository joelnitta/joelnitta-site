title: Fern Species Complexes
---

Evolution was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)#Darwin">famously depicted by Darwin in <i>The Origin of Species</i></a> as a branching tree. However, we now know that the tree of life doesn't just consist of ever-finer splitting branches, but that many of these branches join back together in a process known as __reticulate evolution__. Ferns are notorious for their species complexes, clouds of closely related species with many reticulate relationships between hybrids and their parent taxa. Such complexes have frustrated many a taxonomist trying to draw clear lines between species.

With next-generation DNA sequencing, we finally have the tools to resolve relationships within these difficult groups. I am currently applying two such methods, amplicon sequencing using long-read PacBio technology, and sequence capture of hundreds of low-copy nuclear loci, to untangle relationships within the *Thelypteris angustifrons* species complex.
