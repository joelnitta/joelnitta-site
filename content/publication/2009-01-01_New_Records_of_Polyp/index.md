abstract = "*Polyphlebium borbonicum* is newly recorded in Central and South America and Easternmost Polynesia (Marquesas and Society Islands). It has been misidentified as *P. diaphanum* and as *P. endlicherianum* in the New World and in the Pacific, respectively. *Polyphlebium borbonicum* is distinguishable from true *P. diaphanum* by broader blade segments, and from true *P. endlicherianum* by the absence of a marginal elongate cell row of the lamina."
