abstract = "The Moorea Biocode seeks to compile an integrative taxonomy based on morphological, ecological, and molecular data for the entire macrobiota of the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. As a case study exploring the utility of selected molecular data for species identification within this integrative taxonomic framework, chloroplast DNA from three regions (*rbcL*, *trnSGG*, *trnH--psbA*) were sequenced for all species of filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae) known from Moorea. The relative utility of each of these regions for the purposes of phylogenetic analysis and DNA-based identification was inferred by estimating support for phylogenetic trees reconstructed from each region and by calculating intraspecific and interspecific distance values (uncorrected *p*) between taxa for each region. All three of these regions were found to be potentially useful for phylogenetic studies at the appropriate taxonomic level. *trnH--psbA* was determined to have the greatest utility as a potential marker for DNA-based identification because of its high interspecific variability and high degree of amplification success. *rbcL* and *trnH--psbA* were successfully used in combination with morphological characters to identify a previously unidentified Moorean filmy fern species, *Polyphlebium borbonicum*. The presented results support *trnH--psbA* as appropriate for completing the plant section of the Moorea Biocode, although the use of additional markers will be necessary."
