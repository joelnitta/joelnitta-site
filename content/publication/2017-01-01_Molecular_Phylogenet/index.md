abstract = "The Old World fern genus *Pyrrosia* (Polypodiaceae) offers a rare system in ferns to study morphological evolution because almost all species of this genus are well studied for their morphology, anatomy, and spore features, and various hypotheses have been proposed in terms of the phylogeny and evolution in this genus. However, the molecular phylogeny of the genus lags behind. The monophyly of the genus has been uncertain and a modern phylogenetic study of the genus based on molecular data has been lacking. In the present study, DNA sequences of five plastid markers of 220 accessions of Polypodiaceae representing two species of *Drymoglossum*, 14 species of *Platycerium*, 50 species of *Pyrrosia*, and the only species of *Saxiglossum* (subfamily Platycerioideae), and 12 species of other Polypodiaceae representing the remaining four subfamilies are used to infer a phylogeny of the genus. Major results and conclusions of this study include: (1) *Pyrrosia* as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic in relation to *Platycerium* and can be divided into two genera: *Pyrrosia* s.s. and *Hovenkampia* (gen. nov.), with *Hovenkampia* and *Platycerium* forming a strongly supported clade sister to *Pyrrosia* s.s.; (2) Subfamily Platycerioideae should contain three genera only, *Hovenkampia*, *Platycerium*, and *Pyrrosia* s.s.; (3) Based on the molecular phylogeny, macromorphology, anatomical features, and spore morphology, four major clades in the genus are identified and three of the four are further resolved into four, four, and six subclades, respectively; (4) Three species, *P. angustissima*, *P. foveolata*, and *P. mannii*, not assigned to any groups by Hovenkamp (1986) because of their unusual morphology, each form monospecific clades; (5) *Drymoglossum* is not monophyletic and those species previously assigned to this genus are resolved in two different subclades; (6) *Saxiglossum* is resolved as the first lineage in the *Niphopsis* clade; and (7) The evolution of ten major morphological characters in the subfamily is inferred based on the phylogeny and various morphological synapomorphies for various clades and subclades are identified."
